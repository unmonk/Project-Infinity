Things to do:

PLAYER:
when player collide with MAP_DEATH_LAYER, kill player, subtract life, 
implement lives
improve physics. Right now its just swap velocity.
add attacks (which i have the graphics for, I need to upload)
wall jump has a graphic ready to go. 



ENEMY:
stationary turrents that fire at player (like bullet bill)
enemies that move back and forth
enemies that actively hunt player
I have graphics for these 

GAME: 
when player collides with MAP_ENDOFLEVEL_LAYER, currentLevel += 1
HUD (Lives, ammo?, health?)

TOOLS:
spritesheet() can be removed, im not using anymore

POWERUPS:
+1 lyfe

AUDIO:
I dont have much for this atm. Im figuring some simple background moosic with some shitty sounds for jump and shit.

GUI:
Implement a main menu.

pygame blows
